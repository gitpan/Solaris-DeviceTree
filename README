Solaris::DeviceTree
===================


WHAT IS IT

The "Solaris::DeviceTree" module implements access to the
Solaris device information. The information is collected
from the kernel via access to libdevinfo, the contents of
the file "/etc/path_to_inst" and the filesystem entries
below "/dev" and "/devices". The devicetree is presented as
a hierarchical collection of nodes. Each node contains the
unified information from all available resources.

A script for devicetree inspection (devtree) is included.
Just call 'devtree' without arguments or look at the
manpage for details.

Please note that the quality of the code is still experimental.


CONTACT

The project is hosted at sourceforge. Feel free to visit the

about flaws, the API or other improvements.


OS SUPPORT

This software needs at least Solaris 7 because the libdevinfo
API was first defined in this release. Solaris 2.6 had a libdevinfo
with a different API and can not be used.

It might be a good idea to separate the libdevinfo code from the
parts accessing path_to_inst and /devices so those packages could be
used on earlier releases. However this has not been done yet.

It should compile nicely under x86 although I had no chance
to test it.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This compiles the native interfaces and installs the library
and the devtree binary. To rebuild the C files from the SWIG
you can issue the command

   bootstrap

Of course you need SWIG for that. I used 1.3.19, older
versions may not work due to some template improvements.

For smooth installation on Solaris 9 systems you can build
a Solaris package as add-on to the perl shipped with the os.
Use

   makepkg solperlcc

to build the package using the Sun C compiler (now called "Forte").


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

The binding to the native library is accomplished with SWIG.
