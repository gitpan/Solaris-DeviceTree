=head1 NAME

Solaris::DeviceTree::Libdevinfo::Impl - Foreign function interface to the Solaris
libdevinfo library


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module

The library should not be accessed directly.
Instead use L<Solaris::DeviceTree::Libdevinfo> to access the library.


=head1 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

The FFI has been implemented with SWIG. All necessary functions have
been made available directly to Perl. The translation between the
function interface from libdevinfo and the object-style interface
is done in L<Solaris::DeviceTree::Libdevinfo>, so the C part is
as short as possible.
