BUGS
----

* Does Perl 5.6.1 have Test::More installed as default? -> No
  Check and print warning

FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------

* Add methods to convert between OBP and Solaris pathes
  Fix Util::__solaris_path to solaris_path

* Generate instance numbers for filesystem minor nodes

* Implement ::Util is_tape_node, tape_nodes
* Add tape support to solaris_device

* Change is_block_* to is_disk_*
* Implement ::Filesystem is_disk_*
  use /etc/name_to_major for major->drivername and utilize ::Node is_disk_*

* Enhance devtree with useful functionality
  - Shellscript compatible output
  - identify controllers for scsi, fc, ide
    o controller numbers
    o hardware pathes
  - identify disks
    o disktree printing
    o ctds
    o hardware pathes
    o compare current and historical information
  - identify tapes
    o compare current and historical information
  - print bus mappings
    o include networks, controllers, disks, tapes

* As an additional feature access to the libcfgadm should be included.

* Selection of data source (libdevinfo, path_to_inst, /devices)

* Use semantics for devtree implied in the different data sources (pti=historical, etc.)

* Check methods of Solaris::DeviceTree (nodeid was missing)
  -> implement is_pseudo_node, etc.

* Fix MinorNode::spectype, some return $S_IFCHR, some 'raw'
  -> all return 'raw', documentation is wrong.
     This seems to be a bad idea. Return the int all the time.

* Verify that all published interfaces are tested

* Improve devtree bootdevices with more fault detection

* Sanity checks for unifying hashes and arrays

INTERNAL BEAUTYFICATION
-----------------------

* Solaris::DeviceTree::Node should have a constructor and should be used
  as a base class for all devicetrees.

* Add major_minor like TCT for splitting devts in major/minor

* Test Taint-Mode (see Test::Tutorial)

* makepkg
   - integrate makepkg into Makefile.PL
   - add solperlgcc to makepkg
   - check if Perl 5.6.1 in Solaris 9 has Test::More
     -> No, skip tests if Test::More is not available

* Rework foreign function interface
* Test FFI for Libdevinfo::Impl

COSMETIC
--------

* Use Perl-mode from vim with tab 4 for source, Changelog

* POD
   - Better document info merging in Solaris::DevinfoTree::Overlay
   - More examples to Solaris::DeviceTree


DONE
----

* POD
  Add CVS header to all files

* POD for Solaris::DeviceTree::Libdevinfo::Impl is missing
  (see http://search.cpan.org/dist/Solaris-DeviceTree/)

* Put solaris_device into Solaris::DeviceTree
  -> now in Solaris::DeviceTree::Node

* The methods in ::Util might better be moved to ::Node

* Update and verify Exporter and VERSION interface to Perl 5.6.1 style
  (see perlmod.1 for example)
