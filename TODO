FEATURES
--------

* Generate instance numbers for filesystem minor nodes

* Implement ::Util is_tape_node, tape_nodes

* Enhance devtree with useful functionality
  - Shellscript compatible output
  - identify controllers for scsi, fc, ide
    o controller numbers
    o hardware pathes
  - identify disks
    o disktree printing
    o ctds
    o hardware pathes
    o compare current and historical information
  - identify tapes
    o compare current and historical information
  - print bus mappings
    o include networks, controllers, disks, tapes

DESIGN
------

* Solaris::DeviceTree::Node should have a constructor and should be used
  as a base class for all devicetrees.

* The methods in ::Util might better be moved to ::Node

* Add major_minor like TCT for splitting devts in major/minor
